I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the CVML group of the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Prof. Angela Yao. Before joining NUS, I earned both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees at the VIPL research group of the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), under the guidance of Prof. Xilin Chen and Prof. Ruiping Wang.

My research interests encompass the field of Computer Vision, with a particular emphasis on 3D Human Pose Estimation during my Ph.D. Previously, during my Master’s studies, I explored the incorporation of semantic knowledge in Few-Shot Learning.
